<h1 align="center">Hello, I'm Ä°zzet ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<h5>Behind every complex system, there is a mind trying to understand it. Sometimes, that mind naturally transitions from managing processes to exploring data â€” from experience to analysis.

Iâ€™ve been working in the field of ERP systems and business process digitization for many years. Throughout this time, Iâ€™ve gained not only strong technical knowledge but also hands-on experience in process management, problem-solving, and business analytics.

Over time, I found myself increasingly drawn to working with data, conducting analysis, and learning about machine learning. This interest has gradually turned into a self-driven learning journey. Today, I spend much of my free time exploring data science, machine learning, and deep learning through hands-on exercises and ongoing learning.

I hold a master's degree in data analytics and continuously enhance my technical skills in areas like Python, SQL, data visualization, and fundamental ML algorithms. I actively apply what I learn through small projects and real-world examples.

Combining my background in ERP with a data-driven mindset excites me. I'm always eager to explore new technologies, deepen my understanding, and continue learning â€” not as a requirement, but as a personal passion.</h5>
